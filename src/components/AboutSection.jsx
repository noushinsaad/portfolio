                    I am Noushin, graduated from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of BRAC University.
                    I am passionate about technology and robotics. I am a person who works hard and is enthused, motivated by myself,
                    dependable, and responsible. I am a responsible team player who can easily adjust to problematic circumstances.
                    I can operate well both independently and in a collaborative setting. I can stay on task and meet deadlines even
                    when under pressure.
