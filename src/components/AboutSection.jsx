                    I am a passionate web developer with a strong command of both front-end and back-end development.
                    My skill set includes creating responsive user interfaces with React and building powerful server-side
                    applications with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Additionally,
                    I have a solid foundation in Python programming and experience working with Arduino for
                    robotics and hardware projects. I aim to apply my technical knowledge to meaningful projects,
                    collaborate with talented teams, and continuously refine my skills to deliver exceptional web solutions.
